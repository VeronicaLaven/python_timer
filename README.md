Implement the Pomodoro Technique with this Python timer

This app creates a GUI with a timer, a start button, and a reset button
* when the start button is clicked, the pomodoro_timer function is called to begin the 25 minute countdown
* the timer counts down, updates every second, and when it reaches 0 seconds, triggers an alarm sound
* the reset button resets the timer to 25 minutes as per the Pomodoro Technique as described in the book by Francesco Cirillo
